== Summary ==
=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 1|Chapter One]]===
On December 16th, Anonymous posted a thread. Anonymous was working in a hospital with indisposed people, and there was a new patient which he had come to realize would make an interesting story for /b/. The patient was seven years old (a loli), half-Japanese and half-Scandanavian, and had a gymnast's body which even he, a non-pedophile, found attractive. To make the story even more interesting, the girl had three limbs amputated. With absolutely nothing in mind, Anonymous cynically posted a thread asking whether he should stick it in her pooper.

The thread got a lot of suitably amused posts, but just as many /b/tards wanted to know the details, so Anonymous began supplying them. /b/ also gave suggestions of things he might actually do to be nice to her, but Anonymous explained that he had thought about this and realized that the girl would probably tell one of her several therapists. To be affectionate was to risk his job.

/b/ was angry and /b/ demanded more than just pooper jokes. Anonymous was surprised by this outpouring of sympathy. Anonymous realized he had to summon up his courage, get off of /b/, and approach the girl, to offer her the human affection that she needed. And thus Anonymous became Nurse-kun, the girl became Amputee-chan, and the saga began. 

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 2|Chapter Two]] ===
Without the approval of anyone on staff or the legal team, Nurse-kun snuck into Amputee-chan's room at 1AM to present her with a teddy bear and a Christmasy chocolate orange. He instructed her to keep it secret from the rest of the nurses.

/b/ fills the thread with spam. 

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 3|Chapter Three]] ===
Nurse-kun went to the hospital on his day off to discuss his plans with the other nurses, the psychiatrist, and the administrator. Everyone grudgingly approved, admonishing Nurse-kun to make sure he didn't let her down, or cause her mental instability to worsen.

/b/ complains about whether the story is real. 

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 4|Chapter Four]] ===
Nurse-kun slipped into Amputee-chan's room at 3AM when he heard her crying. She had been having another nightmare about the car crash that killed her parents. Despite her telling him to get out, he reached over and gave her a hug. He wrote it down in the event log, nervously awaiting what would become of him the next evening.

The initial posts of sympathy and congratulations are washed out by the regular 4chan stream of piss as /b/ mercilessly parodies his posts and gets into a huge, dramatic, hour-long argument about whether Nurse-kun is a pedophile. 

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 5|Chapter Five]] ===
Nurse-kun receives a call from Amputee-chan's room and ends up comforting her from another nightmare. The other nurses say that she appears to be doing better and cooperating. The story at this point is calming down a bit. The main complaint is that /b/ doesn't want to read daily reports, although as usual opinion is divided on this matter.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 6|Chapter Six]] ===
Nurse-kun lets Amputee-chan play with his Nintendo DS. At first it doesn't look like it's going to go too well, as she used to be really good, but with her right arm missing she fails hard. Nurse-kun salvages the situation by playing left handed and demonstrating how hard he fails.

The next day he calls her social worker and makes a date to visit the storage facility where all her stuff is being kept to try to find her old DS. Chapter ends as Nurse-Kun goes off to meet the social worker and search through the stuff.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 7|Chapter Seven]] ===
Nurse-kun finds Amputee-chan's Nintendo DS and games in her families storage garage. He wrapped it all up and presented it to her. This is more of a brief update than a real chapter, although one wishes Nurse-kun would have supplied more details.

=== The lost thread ===
This was post 17857804 on /b/. It posted on Christmas Day, when /b/ had become inundated with Christmas hats over the first picture of every thread and everyone was posting a thread to try to make funny pictures out of the hats, so the thread disappeared quickly and was not properly archived. Apparently it was just to wish his readers a merry Christmas.


=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 8|Chapter Eight]] ===
The Return of Nurse-kun
First real post of the new year. Nurse-kun reveals that he actually STUCK IT IN HER POOPER.

He also explained, in a great and somewhat disturbing level of detail, that what he actually stuck in her pooper was a suppository.


=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 9|Chapter Nine]] ===
Nurse-kun Is Shit At Origami
Nurse-kun, in a stunning display of originality, brings an origami book and paper set to work to make mutant animals out of. This goes well.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 10|Chapter Ten]] ===
More origami, Maimed-chan admits she's been staying up late to spend more time with Nurse-kun. Get in there my son!

Also contains a short episode involving Maimed-chan and a disgruntled WWII vet. With almost father-like praise, Nurse-kun explains that this is one loli that doesn't take shit from anyone.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 11|Chapter Eleven]] ===
Short discussion about Amputee-chan's eventual fate, and how the system fails to work. The origin of Nurse-kun's origami idea is revealed. Filler episode.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 12|Chapter Twelve]] ===
More legal bullshit, and Amputee-chan faces disgruntled WWII vet (from Chapter 10) for a 2nd time. Nurse-kun also looks for more suggestions besides origami to use with Amputee-chan.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 13|Chapter Thirteen (13.2)]] ===
Nurse-kun made several attempts to post this, hence 13.2 title. Nurse-kun's cousin gets info from family law friend/attorney; situation looking positive. Amputan has more frequent nightmares since Old-Dude round 2. Nurse-Kun gets permission from shrink and social-worker to proceed w/ mentoring program. awaiting ok from administrator. In other news: Amputan kicks Nurse-kun's ass in Cooking Mama.

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 13b|Chapter Thirteen (13.3)]] ===
After the initial thread disappeared while Nurse-kun was making dinner, he started a second one. Here it is. Contained within is the invitation to the 2007 Amputee-chan valentines day 4chan Valentine contest. Come up with your best valentine for the 14th's /b/ thread!

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 14|Chapter Fourteen]] ===
Nurse-kun returns requesting appropriate valentines for Amputan. Lets hope she never learns the truth behind Waha...

=== [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter 15|Chapter Fifteen]] ===
Nurse-kun gives everyone an update and talks more about her situation, as well as the Waha flipbook. Apparently, /b/ did well with it. Oh, and she also beat the shit out of a paralyzed nine year old boy, but he probably deserved it. 

==New Years' Fake Threads==

===The End? (troll attempt #1)===
A troll posing as Nurse-kun made a final story post on New Year's Eve, saying only this about the situation:

:''"[I] Fucking cared. That was my fucking mistake. Those fucking assholes from her mom's side of the family showed up, out of fucking nowhere, as far as I'm aware, anyway, off she goes, never visit her in the hospital, never call or write or even acknowledge her existence, but they can just walk in and hey, sure, here you go, you're obviously totally qualified to take care of her, and fuck it all fucking merry christmas to fucking retarded me."'' 

Since Nurse-kun says in Chapter 8 that he hasn't posted since Christmas morning, this is likely a troll as first post consisted of nothing but "Hey, /b/." (No.18232915), subsequent posts lacked Nurse-kun's writing style, and the time required to relinquish a ward of the state (in any state) would have made her case worker aware of ampu-tan's family's intentions well before Christmas. It is also possible that Nurse-kun was drunk while writing this post. This (getting drunk)would be the logical thing to do in such a situation.

===Epilogue (troll attempt #2)===
This is of questionable authenticity, but will be really fucking epic if it's true. Most likely a troll, as Nurse-kun admits in Chapter 8 that he hasn't posted since Christmas morning.

:''"Hey, /b/. Happy New Year. I woke up a little while ago, and I guess I'm feeling a bit better...or, at least, a bit more coherent. I'm sorry for all that emo bullshit earlier, it's just that...well, it hurt. But I need to think about what's best for her, not what's best for me...that was always the point, after all, wasn't it? I'll try and get in touch with her social worker tomorrow, see if I can get her new contact information, with the explanation that I had a new years card I wanted to give to her (true), and I need somewhere to send it now. When I can do so, I'll try and talk to her uncle and aunt, offer my expertise, such as it is, as one of her former caretakers, and offer any assistance I can give them, whether it's advice, or anything else...it may be hard, leaving the things and people I know, but it's not about me, it's about her. 

:It's about doing whatever I can to make sure her life got flipped-turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the nurse of a town called Bel Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school...when a couple of guys who were up to no good, started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one lil fight and my mom got scared...She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bel Air'. I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I can say this cab was rare, but I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air!'. I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8, and I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes, smell ya later'; I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there...to sit on my throne as the Nurse of Bel-Air."''
