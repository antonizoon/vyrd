=== 20495315 ===
Hey, /b/. Thread died while I was away making some late dinner, figured I'd start another just in case anyone has anything else to say or ask. Go ahead, if you like, or, well, post just about anything that seems related?

''Can she make the :3 face?''<br>

Yes, and she occasionally does so (well, a natural :3 face, a bit of a smirk, not a forced lip-twisting one) when she beats me at DS. It is as cute as one would think it to be.

=== 20496334 ===
''Does she talk at all about what happened to her to cause her loss of limbs? I would assume she doesn't like talking about it at all. <br>Does she talk at all about growing up using prosthetics?''

No, she never talks about the accident, or her time in the hospital immediately afterward. <br>She does occasionally talk about her future, but it usually isn't very pleasent conversation...she's very negative, and often says that she doesn't HAVE a future, that she'll be dead soon too, that nothing matters, that nobody cares, etc...I generally tell her that I care at that point, and it usually causes her to stop talking and look away, and the subject gets changed soon afterward. The resident shrink has said that her talking about it at all, even if it's nothing positive, is still a good thing, so I don't discourage it, but it's painful to see and hear her doing so...I'm not an expert in reading people, but it sure looks and sounds to me like she believes it.<br>It's more rare for her to talk about her prosthetics at all, except for the occasional recounting of her therapy that day, or asking me to he;lp her get 'into' them to do something or another (usually for her DS).

=== 20496539 ===
''Would it be feasible to get her some DVDs? I had to go and missed your reply.''<br>

Well, it might be, but she doesn't really have anything to watch them on at the moment. Maybe if the other suggestion on a portable DVD player pans out, but not much for the time being. Could bring in my laptop some evening, but the home frowns on our bringing in electronics in general, laptops no exception at all, I'd assume.

=== 20496654 ===
''Nurse-kun, I have to know. Has amputan been getting out of shape during her hospital stay? Is she losing her gymnast figure? Is she exercising? Can she pop a walnut with her abs?''<br>

Well, her rehab keeps her in pretty good shape, she does supplementary exercises at the home in the day, and she doesn't eat all that much, really...so she's at a 'healthy' weight, at least. She does still have a 7 year old's metabolism too, of course.

=== 20496911 ===
''What's she doing about the school she's missing? Does she do any homework in her room or is she missing time from school while she's in rehabilitation?''<br>

The latter. There isn't really as much of a system in place for someone in her situation as there should be, perhaps, since it won't cover/can't handle a private tutor, and nobody on staff is qualified to teach her, and she was at some non-public school for the gifted before the accident, so the link between the Public School System and the Family Services System isn't there to facilitate things...<br><br>...so at the moment, she's just...not being educated in much of anything, other than the rehab.

=== 20497132 ===
''please reveal your valentine's day plans for amputee-tan.''<br>

Nothing too thorough in place yet. If anything happens, it'll be tomorrow night, since while it's technically 'today' while I'll be on duty, it wouldn't count, really. Candy or chocolates are on the agenda for the time being, not sure about anything else for now.

=== 20497284 ===
''Your intentions seem noble but I'm confused. Are you attracted to her? Would you like to have some kind of romance with her in the future?''<br>

No.

=== 20497339 ===
''Anyway, my question: Should I stick it in her pooper (among other things)? I mean, she isn't going to be able to resist, and I can go in there when she's asleep, then cover up her good eye and mouth before she even knows I'm there, with all the drugs she's on. She's so messed up mentally that she probably wouldn't tell anyone, considering she's barely talked to all the shrinks they've had her seeing since the accident. I'm a pretty gentle guy, and there's plenty of lube around here (obviously), and it'd be pretty easy to clean her up afterward, too.''<br>

Yes, because 'So, there's this crippled little girl in my care, and she seems trapped in such a world of pain and sadness. I'd like to he;lp her somehow, but I'm not sure what to do. What should I do, /b/?' would've totally gotten the helpful responses the real one lead to.

=== 20498162 ===
''In the vein of what some others are saying, and I'm hoping people keep at it until you stop being stodgy.
The rape/sex thing do you mean it, or don't you? I get the feeling that you're just trying to be honest with
yourself because you're uncertain. I can respect that. But for her sake and your own, cut the "forseeable future" shit.
Are you a pedophile? Are you fit to be her parent? Will you build her up just to fuck her up all over again?
I hope you can tell the difference between compassion and lust, because there is one despite what the
hippies think. If you think you're strong enought to resist what you may feel, great, I hope to hell you're right.
The suppository chapter has me tad doubting, however.<br>
This is not a troll, I'm genuinely putting this to you. Just so you don't dodge the subject completely''<br>

I'm not dodging anything. I just feel no need to explain myself to strangers asking the same 'questions' in every bloody thread. You can believe what you like, and it's unlikely I can convince you differently directly. Though my response to that [[Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_13b#20497284| other post]] just below yours 'No.' sums up your questions on the majority.

''I'm sure you're sick to death of hearing it but the way you talked about her early on and the suppository chapter were worrying. Hopefully you just didn't think it through before posting.<br>She's traumatized enough without being sexually abused by the only person she trusts. I'm sure you don't want to harm her but it's hard to know what to make of the situation.''<br>

As I've said numerous times, the suppository 'story' was written as satire of all those 'Man, I totally just fucked this woman/little girl' erotic copypastas. Since I'm not much of a Writer, I guess that didn't come through clearly to you. Sorry, I guess.

''Nurse-kun! Hi, I'm studying nursing in Rutgers University and I'd like to tell you that you're my hero. Your story really inspired me to pursue my profession. I'm only in my first year in a 4 year program and I'd like to know how clinicals are and stuff. Oh, and any more advice for nursing school?''<br>

Be sure you really want to do it. Because unlike some of the other low-paying treated-like-shit but-get-to-he;lp-people jobs out there, cops and paramedics, you don't get the authority thrill, get to beat people up (not suggesting all cops are in it for that, just fringe benefits) get to drive a speeding flashing sirening ambulance or get the adrenaline rush of saving a life on the scene. There aren't a lot of fringe benefits, other than the occasional patient that thanks you for helping them when they needed it. If you can handle all that, and you're still interested, then I'm sure you'll make a fine nurse. ...and if you aren't, you can always go back to school later and try being something else, so hey.<br>Personally, I'd say good for you, and welcome to the fraternity (in a non-gender way).

''That GitS shit is awesome. I just finished watching it. That "I do, I do" song had me crying. Manly tears. ;_;<br>

But I'd like to chime in on the pedo question. I'm inclined to think it was a sort of forced /b/ thing though. The first thing any /b/tard would think when they see a loli would be "rape plz ing hawt" from being on /b/ so much and never really dealing with kids, but when you realise the actual situation it become different.''<br>

I get what you're saying. I admit that I probably had a few jokes and such that ran through my head that the 'normal' person wouldn't, just as a /b/flex. Still, I like to think it was mostly the /b/, and less the me.

''I agree, and I caught the satire in the supository story... almost like being Reese's puffed; but it had a bit more originality(as far as writing goes).<br>Someone suggested the improvised munitions handbook for her in the last thread? lol. Would be great hearing from you about how the 3rd-reich guy's bedroom blew up late one night and how bottles of cleaner and batteries are missing.<br>The improvised munitions handbook sucks anyway, if you want to get her anything get her the Poor Man's James Bond. There are better booby traps than the suicide-wish-bombs in the improvised munitions handbook.''<br>

Well, I'm glad someone did!<br>Ah, yes, that may not be the best idea, considering the amount of chemicals scattered throughout the home. But, um, booby-traps, you say? I'm entirely sure I want to come in one night and hear about the morning shift nurse coming in to check on her and getting hoisted up to the ceiling by her ankle via improvised IV tubes-rope or something.

=== 20499834 ===
''Dear Nurse-kun<br>Could you print this out and give it to her?''<br>

That seems unlikely, unfortunately, though I did lol. ...of course, if anyone else wants to give it a go at coming up with something for her, they are more than welcome to try! No deadline tonight, I can make a decision tomorrow?<br>

God knows that /b/ and 4chan can come up with some creative shit when it feels like it, any chance of someone putting this little invitation on the wiki's front page?

(imageflood of "the Dude", from Tin Cup)<br>

Fascinating as this divergance into the mythology of the Dude is, I suppose I should interrupt it to mention I'll be leaving in 10-20 minutes for work, so if you have anything to ask or say, you should probably do it soon.<br><br>Carry on.

''no word from her grandparents huh? <br>how is she interacting with the rest of your staff? better, worse?''<br>

No, still no word from her family. Well, her relatives. And she's interacting about the same as she was before, though she had a small incident last week when one of her day nurses dropped her DS (well, bumped it off her desk), and she had a minor freakout about whether it was broken, which involved some insulting language.

=== 20501908 ===
(Shitty emo poetry...)<br>

Wow. Um, on that note, I really need to get going for work. I'll sign back on tomorrow to see if there are any other entries of the valentineish sort, though I'm not sure how one could...top...this.

''did she have any friends before the accident? do any of them try to visit her?''<br>

Yes, she had friends, no, they don't visit her anymore. I've been told she lashed out a fair bit and burned a lot of bridges post-accident when they showed up, and kids don't tend to like dealing with disfigurations, even if they're gifted little angels, even if parents don't like to admit it, or that they don't particularly like such people either. I guess. Not a shrink myself. Gotta go now. Night, /b/!
