<p>This Nurse-kun now uses the tripcode "<strong>Nurse-kun</strong> !!hPl7vWPKR+W" for identification purposes. Remember kids, real <a href="http://nk.vyrd.net/tripcode">tripcode</a> aren't bold, only the Username portion.</p>

<p>Hey, /b/. It's been a while, I know, but I thought I'd give this another shot, since things have calmed down slightly as of late in my personal life, and I did say I might be back in a month or so in my last post...which I just remembered a few days ago. I wasn't very thrilled to get accused of being an imposter of...myself, my writing style that day apparently being sub-par and 'not like the real Nurse-kun's'. Well, a friend of mine told me that he dropped in to let you know that I was having some trouble at the time that was weighing heavily, and I figured, fuck it, I might as well just tell you, though I'm not looking for attention via doing so, merely offering it as an explanation.
You can judge for yourselves then, though I can't say I'm overly inspired at this point.
(As a side note, the picture I'm posting with this is beautiful, and to whoever did it: You touched me when I saw it.)</p>

<h3>23586624</h3>

<p>My father has cancer. Pancreatic cancer, which they've caught too late to have much chance of 'curing'. He had an attack of pain so severe that it left him curled up in a fetal position on the kitchen floor in the house I grew up in, and this man, that I've never seen make so much as a sound in my life when he's been hurt, couldn't keep from screaming. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance against his own urgings, and within twelve hours, they had the diagnosis. I took the night off work when I heard about this, and was there when the doctor gave his results. That was two days before the last time I posted, wherein I was trying to relate the story of our trip to the zoo, on the previous friday, before the incident.
I may not be an oncologist, but I've worked with enough patients in various areas of our system to know what a late-caught pancreatic cancer diagnosis means. I suppose I shouldn't have posted at the time, should've taken some more time off before doing so, but I actually thought to myself: 'Hey, maybe it'll cheer me up a little.'. Shows just how messed up this little affair has left me, to think this about /b/, huh?</p>

<h3>23586994</h3>

<p>Anyway, after I said 'fuck this shit' and left, my life went on. I began a new juggling act, between my girl and my father, with her social worker, after the third outing, to a hockey game, actually, giving her approval to me as a 'mentor', thus ending the chaperoning. So for the past four weeks or so, I've averaged three or four afternoons a week with him and my mom (he's gotten pretty sick of us 'hovering' at this point, but she seems to need it), and two or so with her. This hasn't left a lot of time for even the wreck of a social life I had before, but while I can say 'fuck this' to you guys, saying it to them is just a bit harder.</p>

<h3>23587323</h3>

<p>But I'll tell you a story now, first, just to get the personal 'whoring' out of the way. After all, I'm quite aware of what those of you that are interested in this at all are here for.
About a week after my father's initial hospitalization, when I was at work, and somewhat distractedly playing a game of chess with her, she was quiet for a long while, until the game was nearly over, then looked up at me, and asked me what was wrong. I was somewhat surprised, and snapped out of my own thoughts, which had indeed been centered on my family's 'problem'. I'd been nearly as out of it with her as I had been on here, and she'd clearly noticed, but not said anything until then.</p>

<h3>23587784</h3>

<p>I finally told her, after hesitating and thinking about it for a good minute or so, just what was happening. She listened quietly, not interrupting, as I related the details, and when I was finished, and I looked down quietly, feeling bad now that I'd layed that on her, which I certainly wouldn't do with a 'normal' girl her age, she proceeded to move her bishop, and say "Checkmate".
I couldn't help but laugh, after a few seconds. As she watched me, rubbing my eyes as I did so, I caught a hint of a smile, a grin, even, though it was as fleeting as a spring breeze. Once I'd gotten it out of my system and congratulated her on beating me, as usual, she surprised me again, by quietly saying, "Sorry.". She clarified, a moment later, that she meant about 'my dad', and then she seemed to be the one hesitating, before speaking in a bit of a rush, telling me: "...it's...hard.".</p>

<h3>23588139</h3>

<p>Whatever pain and regret I'd been feeling, both for myself and for involving her in it, magnified themselves as she said that in a near-whisper, staring down at my captured king in her hand, resting in her lap. I set the board aside and moved from my chair to sit on the edge of her bed, and tentatively put an arm around her shoulders, as she squeezed her eyes shut. I told her that I was sorry, that I shouldn't have dragged her into my own problems, my voice faltering a bit as I saw that she was fighting to hold back tears then, and dropped the chess piece to hold her hand over her eyes, as if to hide them.
Feeling like a real piece of shit, I stroked her hair, and apologized again, then thanked her for her sympathy, telling her she'd helped me feel better for it; the fact that I now felt even worse than before was no obstacle to my saying so. Then she said something that I haven't been able to forget since.</p>

<h3>23588909</h3>

<p>"I hate that girl in Elite Beat Agents. Real life isn't like that.". I'd known pretty much from the start that that stage in that game wasn't going to go over well, and while she didn't play it when we were together, and had said in the past that she 'didn't like it', it'd been a somewhat low-key do not want. I wasn't really sure what the right response would be, but after she lapsed into silence, I had to try something, so I eventually simply nodded slightly, and said 'No, it isn't.'. I mean, sure, the rest of the game is ridiculous as well, but this was hardly the time for a smart-assed response.
Then, after a moment more of silence, she spoke up again, voice hauntingly painful: "...people just go away. Forever.". And despite her delivery, her previous composure, as she finished the final syllable in that word, her vocie quavered, and she started crying. Not having anything to say that could fix that, I just held her, and did my best not to make things any worse.</p>

<h3>23589052 (Inconceivable)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Hey Nurse-kun, if you put something in the e-mail feild, even just a random word, it makes the tripcode stand out a lot more and people can't spoof it like that</em>
Huh, didn't know that. Thanks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>23589313 (You keep using that word...)</h3>

<p>Not much else happened that night...she eventually settled down a bit, and I helped dry her eyes and cheeks, and told her, with as much sincerity and honesty as I could summon forth, that she was the most special girl I knew, and that I really did feel better now. She fell asleep a few minutes later, clutching my hand as tightly as she ever had outside of a nightmare incident, and as I sat there with her for a while longer, I have to admit...I did feel better, for all the pain the whole thing stirred up.</p>

<h3>23589675 (I do not think it means what you think it means.)</h3>

<p>I made a formal application for adoption within the week. I don't know...maybe the combination of this event and her words made it clear to me that life is short, and sitting on the sidelines just gives you a good view while it passes you by. When I took her, for one of our outings, back to my family home, at her request and my mother's approval, it certainly seemed crystallized for me, as I watched her, sitting in her chair in the living room beside my father, half-asleep due to the painkillers, in his recliner, reach out and rest her little hand on top of his big, work-worn one...I can't really say with any surety.
All I can say is that I know I'm doing the right thing. And I'll see it through, no matter what it might cost me.</p>

<h3>23589927 (I threw a rock at him!)</h3>

<p>Anyway...not sure I have the energy to post a summary of every single outing or event that went down at the moment, but I suppose I can open up the floor for questions...and see where things go. I actually have the day off for once, so no need to dash off just yet. Hm.</p>

<h3>23590190 (...it was a big one...)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>oh shit, I must have missed a chapter or so, I didn't know that you had taken her out of the nursing home already. Awesome dude, good for you.</em>
No, she's still there. But I've begun the journey to try and adopt her. Thus far, her social worker hasn't raised any major flags when I spoke to her about it, though she's told me what most other people have: that it isn't going to be easy. But then, I knew that going in...</p>

<h3>23590826 (She didn't think too much of the bears, either.)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Should this whole "one mans quest to adopt a loli" thing actually pan out, can we still expect updates on amputans daily progress?</em>
<em>Or are you just going to disappear in the sunset?</em>
Honestly not sure. I haven't thought quite that far ahead...</p>

<h3>23591619</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>You also need to sought out her schooling and everything. Does she have to go to a special needs school? How soon can she start school again?</em>
<em>Edumaction is important.</em>
Thus far, she hasn't really recieved any schooling since she's been at the home...really heartening to see the system working, yeah. If it works out, I'd probably be homeschooling her until she's got the rehab down to an art, since she's made it clear she still hates the chair, and if she could walk, even with some help from me, we wouldn't be using it on our outings. Since her mental faculties are unharmed, she'd likely not need a 'special needs' school, though she's still got a long way to go in dealing with her trauma, so she probably wouldn't be the perfect boring student. It's something we'll need to face when we face it.
<em>Are you sure this is the best moment to start such a process? It certainly won't lessen your stress form your father's cancer? /b/ worries for you, Nurse-kun.</em>
Maybe not. But I think I'd wind up in worse shape if I let her sit in that bed in that home for another six months, just to use an abstract number, without doing what I think I need to do. If I know my dad, he'd say I'm doing the right thing...he was a good one, after all...</p>

  <p><em>Cool. Let me start by saying congratulations on taking the really big leap and trying for adoption. With everything else in your life at the moment, that's quite a step to take. This story made me tear up a bit ;</em>;_
<em>Now, if it's not too irritating, can I ask a few housekeeping type questions.

<em>So the thread a month ago was a real outing and you did go to the zoo? There was a nurse-kun post a few days ago with a different tripcode that contradicted that, but it seemed very flakey.

<em>I realize these questions seem a little dumb in the grand scheme of things, but I think the way to look at it is that there are enough people who honestly care about this story and how it turns out that they want to see how it really ends without being led on or bel-aired.</em>
Now, the biggest post that got eaten...whooo.
Not sure how to deal with having a non-serial killer copycat. Not that I'm a serial killer with serial killer copycats. ...ahem.
Yes, the thread a month ago was real, and we really went to the zoo. No, any posts between then and today weren't me. 300? Really? Christ.
Ah, the wiki. Yes, that was me. But I realized after a few posts that it was pretty dumb to post there with my ip hanging out, proxy or otherwise, particularly since I'm not very good with them. So I stopped using it. Unfortunately, between then and now, I've forgotten the password for the account, as it wasn't one of my 'usual' ones. So I can't access it, and barring some haxxoring, nobody else can either, so I can honestly say we've seen the last of Nurse-kun on the wiki. Sorry?</p>

  <p><em>It's obvious she's grown more open with you, but has that extended to other people so far?</em>

</blockquote>

<h3>23592690</h3>

<p>Not much has changed with regard to the rest of the staff, the resident shrinkette, her rehab nurses. She's started seeing a specialist in childhood psychiatric trauma at the children's hospital once a week, but she's still distant and reserved with her, too. The rest of the residents/patients and her rehab peers have been generally avoided as usual, but not fought with, so that's something...though a small stuffed lion was thrown at the head of an obnoxious brat at the zoo, who ran wailing to her parents, who had little sympathy once they heard what she'd said out of their earshot. The lion was retrieved and dusted off, and no blood was spilled...this time.
The incident with my dad...I think he was too out of it to really acknowledge it, or likely even remember it, but my mom saw it from the kitchen, along with me. We didn't mention that we'd seen it to her, didn't want to embarass her or something...but I'm pretty sure my mom was really touched by me...as was I, of course. While we were there, she was on the best behaviour I've seen thus far, and while not really friendly as such, as not-unfriendly as I've seen her, too. So that was nice...</p>

<h3>23592801</h3>

<p>Finally...oh, yeah, I heard about the wiki going down...my old link doesn't seem to work anymore. Anyone have a new one for me?</p>

First, to everyone: Sorry guys, these mysql failures are horrendous. Is it always like this around here now? I don't remember it ever being this bad, aside from around GET-time.
Now, to this: Actually, it was this one. She likes metroid. And got the chozo joke, and seemed to think it was pretty funny. It's hanging on her wall alongside her bed; I said a 'friend of mine' did it, which is close enough. I'd show her others, but too much would be...odd, I'd think, and, well. Hm.</p>

And just to second this; new fanart is always welcome in these threads. Even if she might not see it (yet), I appreciate it, anyway. And hey, that metroid pic was produced well into this little journey of ours, so it isn't as though it's impossible for her to see it either, if it seems appropriate.</p>

  <p><em>Nurse-kun, have you ever toyed with the idea of opening a donation for Amputee-chan? I'd be very willing to help this little girl which I also grew somewhat attached to through your story.</em>
I considered it, but ruled it out after brief consideration. First, there's the anonymity issue. Second, I've never gone begging to strangers for money before, and I'd rather not now. And third, whenever someone DOES go begging to strangers, human nature prompts others to try and wreck that shit. Besides, I'd hardly want moot or snacks to come after me for diverting revenue away from 4chan.
But thanks for the thought, that much is appreciated and accepted.</p>

The odds are.....slim. He's scheduled to go in for a surgical attempt at a whipple procedure soon, but the feeling I got from the doctors, though they wouldn't say it out loud, is that the odds aren't looking good...I'm afraid that palliative care may be the only real viable option at this point, as much as I may not want it to be the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>23597446</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Yeah the anonymous issue, i was giving that a lot of thought and frankly i have no idea how one could anonymously help you. The thought of donating just came to mind because like you mentioned a couple of times that taking further care of her (when you finally do get to adopt her *hope*) it will cost you an assload of money. And even if here parents left here some money it will not suffice endlessly... Just my 2 cents.</em>
<em>On another note: I've been searching through the archived threads. Either I'm blind or you really never mentioned her birthday. That coming up soon? Plans?</em>
Her birthday's in the summer, so not just yet. Though I do intend to make sure it gets done right, rather than the abominations that pass for one in the nursing home.</p>

Right...I mean, I'd certainly think it's a big consideration. Actually, I was in /co/ earlier, and I saw one of the constant Ben10 threads (a show I haven't seen myself, but I have been in /co/, so hey), which was filled with pictures of the female character at a waterslide park. And it hit me like a ton of bricks (that may have been shat).
I'm glad, in a way, that it's still a way off, and I don't really have to think about it that much right now, though I'll have to before it's a week away.</p>

Actually, her tastes are pretty eclectic. She hasn't asked for any Dragonforce just yet (or other heavy metal that I know of, actually), but she has blues, rock, some bluegrass, some electronic stuff, pop...I'm not much into music myself, so I'm not much help to her there, other than ferrying her iPod back and forth between my internet connection and her ears.</p>

  <p><em>one thing, was she white or asian? i remember hearing she was japanese but all the fanart depicts her blonde hair blue eye</em>
Her father was a first-generation Scandanavian-American, full-out blonde hair and, actually, blue eyes, pale (but tannable) skin, tall stature, etc. Her mother was fourth or fifth-generation Japanese-American. Seems the dice rolled such that she got much of his colouring, with a mix of their facial traits and such. It's an interesting combination, I can't really describe it that well, not being an artist, but she's got a roughly even blend of caucasian and japanese features, small but not puggish button nose, good cheekbones, eyes are somewhere in-betweenish, strong but not pronounced chin, etc...kind of a cross between a really cute japanese girl and a really cute nordic-type girl. And I think she's very cute, though I suppose that's subjective for some people. And yes, her eyes are green, and her hair is an ashy blonde...it's not barbie or raincoat yellow, but it is blonde.
I'm not a geneticist, but I know I've seen pictures of other half-japanese people that turned out natural blonde and blue/green eyed before, so I hardly think it's THAT bizarre.

I'm not entirely sure about her whole family history. I know her mom was a fourth/fifth generation Japanese-American, I'm not sure what may have happened in either sides of her family stretching back in the 70+ years before now. I saw a picture and she looked pretty Japanese to me, (and pretty pretty, too, though I kind of feel bad saying so, still, she was), but I'm not an expert in picking up heritage through traits and such.</p>

The elbow, wrist aand fingers are all pretty necessary to play the instruments she knows, or most instruments, even. I mean, wasn't Def Leppard's one-armed drummer a below-elbow amputee, even? As it stands the current generation just doesn't have the speed or dexterity to handle musical performances beyond, like, kindergarten stuff, which she was somewhat beyond already. Even with some piano pieces written specifically for a pianist with just his left hand after WWI (I think) would still require foot pedals, I think, so even there she's kind of screwed...it's not very good, as it stands. Synthesizers and electronic stuff seems like her best choices for right here and now, and she's refused to try it when I've offered to get some software on my laptop and smuggle it in for her to try out, so...</p>

Well, I like to think I'm not an emotional vampire, whatever the fuck that's supposed to be. I'm obviously leaving out a fair bit and using my own words to try and convey the actions and thoughts and motivations of people other than myself, and since I'm no great author, I'm likely to come off a bit sour in my 'notes' every now and then. Guess I can only say 'sorry' and try harder next time, while assuring you I don't suck quite the way you think I do?

Hey, if someone wants to write a story based on this, whatever, go ahead. Selling it? I dunno, I'd feel somewhat less neutral or positive about that.

  <p><em>is the social worker aware of your current family issues? would moving to adopt her now raise any additional flags because of it?</em>
Yes, she is. Part of the conversation we had when I saw her after submitting my application for adoption was about my father's condition, and how it'd affected my decision to move forward with this. She'd already known I was considering the possibilities, and said that she could see how my father's diagnosis could make me evaluate my own life, and my future.
She was pretty supportive, even as she was honest about how difficult it'd still be; even so, she said that his condition probably wouldn't negatively affect my chances, anyway...and might make it more clear to the people that decide these things why I'd do so.</p>

It's weird, and not particularly like anything I've experienced before. I've never been much of an attention seeker, so having this much paid to me is...a new experience, and somewhat unsettling.
I mean, you guys want the truth? My initially posting about this on 4chan, let alone /b/, wasn't even my idea. When I was discussing her with the friend I mentioned in the OP, who posted in the last thread, he suggested that I post about her here, and we started joking about what a discussion about her in here would be like, and, well, that's where most of the ideas for poopering, and generic copypasta 'raep teh loli' stuff came from.

<h3>23613961</h3>

<p>She's improved in some areas, and not as much in others. The car ride to the zoo, for example, was nearly identical to the downtown core the previous time. It may have been slightly 'better' for her because the previous one was her longest trip since the accident, but I can't say I really noticed a major difference...she kept her iPod on loud enough that I could make out words from my spot beside her, and that was over the noise of the engine and traffic, which were not inconsiderable.</p>

<h3>23614398</h3>

<p>She's still having the nightmares...it's just that after the first few descriptions, there didn't seem to be much more I could say without sounding like I was tugging at heartstrings and copypasta-ing myself. It's almost disturbing how similar they are; she relives the crash and the subsequent entombment in the car with her dead parents, then the firefighters and paramedics showing up and cutting her out of it, then the trip to the hospital, and her experience in the ER...
...she remembers EVERYTHING. Every time. Unless she breaks out of it herself and manages to wake up, or I'm close enough to hear her whimpering and talking in her sleep (which sometimes turn into screaming), and I wake her up. Then I sit with her, and hold her, and do my best to comfort her, and help her calm down, and dry her eyes...
This is still happening an average of three times a week, sometimes as much as five, used to average five and sometimes happen every night in the hospital post-accident.</p>

<h3>23614922</h3>

<p>I don't discuss them much anymore because I don't like thinking about them, and about what she's going through. I had nightmares for a while myself as a child, though nothing like this, and thinking about her...well.
She's still roughly as prone to PTSD 'attacks' as before, mostly when she gets stressed out, when she's exposed to things that bother her...she'd start freaking out when she needed an MRI in the hospital, and even being in her washroom makes her visibly tense. Our resident shrink reports not much progress with her new specialist at the children's hospital (another longer car-ride a week, which she isn't too happy about), but it may simply be an issue of trust, as well.</p>

<h3>23615768</h3>

<p>She's still working hard at her physical rehabilitation...and making more progress, even slow as it is, than on the other fronts. She's now making it halfway down the parallel bars walk of glory on her own just about every session, and can make it there and back again without a major stumble with a nurse's help, most days. Of course, she needs to rest and recover afterward. Unfortunately, her phantom pain is still as bad as ever, and it often acts up after a rigorous session.
She's working hard with her arm and hand as well, and making progress in coordinating the use of her elbow, wrist, and grip...nearly as quickly as any patient she's had before, her primary nurse there says. Her use of her left hand has just kept improving as well...considerably faster than mine has, as I provide less and less challenge to her at EBA and Ouendan.</p>

<h3>23616096</h3>

<p>Basically, she's trying her best with what she's capable of changing, and trying to accept and deal with what she can't...though I don't think she'd much care for being compared to a religious prayer. She continues to be awesome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[More suggestions about learning to interrupt bad dreams by oneself]</em>
