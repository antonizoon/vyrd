This **chapter** consists of 4 threads, one frome dis.videogames, one from /v/, two from /b/. They are made of pokemans and friend codes.

## /v/ 3752736 Part **23**(a) May 31st, 2007  ##

Posted as Nurse-kun !!hPl7vWPKR+W

### 3752736  ###

Hey, /v/. I have a question, if it isn't too much trouble for you. With pokemon pearl (or diamond, I guess), when one exchanges friend codes, does one give up personal or IP information of some sort? And, more importantly, what are the capacities for communication over wireless and such? Can one send text messages, or things like that, or is it limited to non-personalized battling and trading and such?
See, I'm considering whether it's wise to solicit said codes for wireless play for a certain someone, or...not so much.
Picture not entirely related, but /v/ish.

### 3752762  ###

>  _Grow some fucking balls and stop being such a pussy_
I'll get right on that.

### 3752802  ###

>  _I don't see how. unless there's some way to use the Friend code as a dowsing rod for IP addresses. They don't really have anything to do with one another. If you take a DS or Wii to a different IP, it still uses the same friendcode._
>  _tl;dr: what >>3752743 said_
Yes, but what about the communication issue? Just what can one do to communicate with someone you have a friend code with? I can't check the manual and such, because it's still in the box, which is still in the store, on hold for me.

### 3752864  ###

>  _VOIP_
Can one turn that off?

### 3752933  ###

>  :: _I've seen people on 4chan who have it disabled. I'm not really sure how, but they might just have their volume turned off. In which case... Nintendo Wifi can sense that it's off 'cause it shows a "no megaphone" icon by their name._
>  _yes.. but if you try to connect to someone with it on, you must turn your VOIP on_
>  _if you invite with VOIP off, they must deactivate VOIP to do stuff with you_
Hmm, I see...

>  _I imagine covering the mic with a piece of thick tape might be a low-tech solution as well._
>  _Too bad my wifi's shot to hell and back, or I'd gladly try it out for you._
That's a good idea, actually. I wouldn't have thought of that. Hmm. At this rate, it looks like I may need to do some test driving before I make a decision and hand it, and potentially friend codes people may offer, over to her one way or another...
Thanks.

### 3753024  ###

Okay, another question...if you had the opportunity, would you play some pokeymans with her? I can't really say how she'd 'behave' on it, but she's certainly a lot more tolerable to me than any other kid her age I've spent time with...but I suppose I'm a bit biased.

### 3753065  ###

>  _Are you sure 4chan is the best crowd to introduce a young girl to? We may be awesome at pokemon, but we are really lousy babysitters._
Oh, believe me, I'm well aware. Thus, the basis for all this questioning: How much can I, well, scotchguard the pokeymans to keep 4channers from ruining it all with her?

### 3753076  ###

>  _One arm? I don't get it. Cute drawings though._
Yes, she has one arm, one eye, and she's missing her legs above the knee; a result of which, along with the orphaning due to her parents dying in the crash that inflicted said injuries, she's living in a nursing home, surrounded by old people and professional caregivers, as a ward of the state.
As such, she doesn't really get out much, or get to play or interact with people her own age, which is why I'm considering any of this at all.

### 3753083  ###

### 3753096  ###

>  _O vey, you'd better prepare her for 4chanians then. Must liek Mudkip and fuck yeah Seaking._
Well...she was quite handy with the internets, apparently, before the accident, and losing her home/room/own PC/internet access/etc. And with young and intelligent parents, I'm fairly sure, as she's told me herself, that they taught her how to be careful on it. So she isn't an entirely wideeyed Amish kid exposed to the online abyss for the first time.
Still, if it's limited to seeing Seakings named 'Fuck Yeah', that'd be acceptable. It isn't as if she hasn't heard such words before, after all.

I don't know of any forums with such people, though I'm trying to think of some. I don't really browse nintendo or pokeymans forums, y'know? Not that there's anything wrong with that...
...even so, I'm not sure how much good it would do, as she has yet to initiate contact with anyone her own age when we've been out and about thus far...not peaceful contact, anyway. She has some issues with 'normal' kids...

She's seven. Well, eight, in a few months. And no...she doesn't. Not anymore, anyway.

That sort of thing would be what I'm worried about...well, not **wikichan**, really, since her only form of internet access is her DS, and she doesn't have the web browser thing I think I saw somewhere once, but problematic mails through trades and such in general, ranging a gamut of various subjects. My best idea is to ask her to let me read them first when she gets one, since she knows how people can behave online, though I'm not sure the game supports that, or such. Been a while since I played one, and not the new version yet.

Yes, and as her link to the internets, whether she knows it or not...well, surely you can see where the train of logical conclusion is going?

### 3753289  ###

>  _Good luck then, it's safe. Unless a /b/tard manages to trade friend codes, and decides to spell out a message to ask her to check _**_wikichan_**_ via Pokeman names._
So long as it doesn't have the capability to spell out complex original messages, it's fine. It uses pre-set phrases and buzzwords?

### 3753358  ###

>  _Also, hi Nurse-kun ;_;_
Hi. Cheer up, you guys, it's a beautiful day where I am...and dwelling on the dark won't accomplish anything. I know that, despite my frequent jokes (well, partial jokes) about the toxicity of 4chan, there are probably at least a few people on here that actually care about her. Which is why I'm asking this here, and considering the possibility of trying to find some of those people for friend codes, at all.
People are always saying that I 'restore their faith in humanity' or 'inspire them to do more with their lives' or such, which is hard for me to believe, because I'm just, you know, a guy. But the truth is, a lot of you have given me a new way of looking at Anonymous, as well. Hm, tired, sentimental.

### 3753365  ###

>  :: _with pokemon names, you can put basically whatever you want._

Yeah, that'd be a bit much, conceiving a 60 character message by naming their pokemon and sending them out in a specific order...

### 3753463  ###

Not right now, no. I need to go to bed.

## /b/ 28663290 Part **23**(b) June 2nd, 2007  ##

Posted as Nurse-kun !!hPl7vWPKR+W

### 28663290  ###

Hey, /b/. Okay, so, she was playing her new copy of Pokemon: Pearl for the DS when I saw her again last night. After filling me in on what'd happened in the game since I last saw her, and commenting on how stupid she thought Team Galaxy's haircuts were, she lapsed into a somewhat more depressed mood, then looked down and said, "I'm such a loser. I can't even play with other people when they build a wireless mode into it.".
Which, naturally, made me feel bad for multiple reasons. Bad enough that I told her I could probably find some people that wanted to play with her on the internet, the only problem being that they were strangers, and that I knew she already knew about strangers on the internet (from her pre-accident days of using it under the supervision of her parents). Still...it had me wondering if the rewards may outweigh the risks. What do you think?

### 28663824  ###

>  _its team galactic faggot_
>  _lurk moar_
Well, I'm not the one playing it, I was going off her account, and don't have a perfect memory. What can I say?

### 28663963  ###

>  _If you ID her like this, EVERYTHING you've worked for and built will be destroyed in ONE night. From what I've read about her, DON'T do it._
Well, I haven't done it yet, now have I? Frankly, I'm still not even sure entirely how it works, though /v/ sort of helped me a few days back. You can't do much with just someone else's friend code, right? You need to get them to accept yours as well, right?

### 28664179  ###

>  _By the way, Nurse-kun, she can only battle us if we give you our codes as well, so you can choose who to have her fight._
See, this is helpful. Thanks. I believe there's a way to turn voice chat off as well, right? Which I don't think would be much of a problem for her, since she doesn't tend to like talking to people she doesn't know, anyway...

### 28664364  ###

>  _You can find people on the internet in places other than /b/. It would be completely retarded to post it here._
>  _If you do, don't identify her, just do it in an "ITT friend codes" manner._
>  _BTW, is it possible to do the internet stuff through no$gba?_
That was the plan, if it seemed at all feasible on other fronts. I wasn't planning to ID her as, well, who she is. The big issue is the voice chat, and the sort of messages and text communication one can engage in over wifi.

### 28664489  ###

>  _i'd prolly go out and buy a ds just to play with her and make her happy, though i'm not the normal /b/tard being a father and all.._
...of course, this is the other side of things. I know this may sound foolish, but I believe that at least some of you might actually care for her, and not in a pooper sort of way. Which would seem, to me, to be a better choice than some random punk on a nintendo forum, who couldn't care less. Thus, the confliction...

I saw a news story about her when it was pointed out to me in another thread, in /v/, I believe, yes. Good for her. Still considering whether to show it to her or not.

### 28664966  ###

>  _Nurse-Kun you're awesome, keep it up._
>  _And I want her friend code. I'm a nice person, I swear._
Herein lies another problem. Even if I did find decent people on here, how would I get a friend code to them, but not to all the /b/tardegenerates, as well? I don't really do the IMing thing in general, and in particular not as 'Nurse-kun', for security reasons...
...is it possible for her to contact YOU guys if you give me your codes, instead?

>  _Welp, I'll play._
>  _Lemme get my DS._
>  _Ill post FC in a bit._
>  _What cap? 50? 100?_
Um, well, if this does happen, I'm not going to be seeing her until I go in to work tonight, which is at least eight hours away. Also, she just started playing thursday afternoon, and has only beaten two gyms so far. She isn't quite up there yet. (Well, she may have beaten three by the time I see her, but still)

Really? See, I thought it worked that way, but I couldn't be sure...of course, thanks to /b/'s nature, I still can't. Is this how it works?

### 28665483  ###

Since monday? No.

Well, she apparently swept the grass gym with just her star-something bird. It seems she couldn't find any fire types, and 'the penguin sucks', so she gave up and just went in with that one, and, well, pulled it off. I thought it was pretty funny, in a cool sort of way. Then she found the fire pony a half hour or so later.

>  _All that you've worked for will be ruined._

If it ever happens, it'll be strictly voice chat off. /v/ told me that the only other way one can actually string letters together is through naming your pokemon and some sort of decorations faggotry, so...it seems possible, at least, to be managed. I mean, I assume nintendo sort of designed it that way on purpose, didn't they?

No, I just sort of implied 'Just plz don't be a dick'. Which should go without saying when playing with anyone, but hey, as you've proven, /b/.

### 28666234  ###

I meant more for battling and such than traded nicknames. I've heard a lot about seakings named 'Fuck Yeah!' for instance. Of course, living in a hospital, then with a lot of older people with diminishing mental faculties, not to mention health care workers, who are as prone to swearing under their breath as anyone, she's heard enough dirty words to bring her up to speed and desensitize her already...

>  _maybe fish not allowed in hospital though :(_
Yeah, any pets, even little goldfish equivilants, aren't allowed at the home...there have been a few visits from one of those 'pets for seniors' programs that bring animals by for a visit every now and then, but she's always stayed at the back of the room and refused to participate when it happened...I think 'losing' her kitty when she lost her home after the accident is still too painful to ignore so far.
She hasn't nicknamed even one of her pokeymans as far as I can tell, either. I'm not sure if it's connected, though...

I already told you, she's only gotten a little way into the game so far. All she's had to handle so far is an old rod!

### 28667148  ###

For the record. She was using the internet a fair amount before the accident, as makes sense for an intelligent young girl from an intelligent young family of professionals. The parents making up the rest of said family having educated her on the perils of the internets, and how to remain safe from said perils whilst surfing the highway, to mix metaphors. She already knows there are 'bad people' out there, as we (she and I) have in fact discussed, when I told her there was a possibility of getting friends codes from said internets. She isn't a wideeyed retarded naif from Amish country, nor a sheltered mystic named after a precious stone, people, even if she is still a child, and thus not nearly fully aware of precisely what constitutes the 'bad stuff' people can do.Just for the record.

Oh, and to follow this up: Since the only computer access available in the facility is for the staff, at workstations and in offices (the policy is not so up to date as to provide internet access to the old people in our place, no siree), her DS is still pretty much her only internets-capable device available to her (possibly to any patient). And she doesn't have that internets program/cartridge/something I've heard about, if it exists at all (I just play the games, yo).

Look, I don't go to other forums or websites or whatever where I could get some answers and opinions on the intricacies of the game's wifi system, let alone how it relates to her particular situtation. I haven't given out her friend code yet. Geez. Cut me some slack.

Well, she apparently had a couple of the gardevoir evolution family in the previous generation, and liked them. And thinks this whole 'lol have to catch 'em all (even if only catch sight of) before you can trade between versions' thing is 'stupid'.

Um, well, even if it WAS me, the best way would probably be to behave as you might while being friendly with someone you don't know. Social contract and all that. If you're okay with just going up to someone you don't know and saying hello in a friendly manner, well, more power to you, just be ready for the chance it isn't me, and consider accordingly.

If anyone Trades her anything it'll work, Its just the GTS where you have to see it first before you can get it.**' I think she was talking about the system for trading between GBA carts and the new games, but, right. She's hesitated at going into GTS and such so far.**

She isn't interested in communication, she's interested in some pokeyman fights and maybe some trading. And stuff. I'm just trying to think about how easily one can mess with that in a nintendo game, and how to handle that creativity.

You dont want to risk anything, not just for you being found out, but for her own sake. With her sensitive nature and overall _**_damaged_**_ mental state (hope that term doesnt offend you, but i cant really describe it otherwise), you dont want to risk someone saying something to here, text message or otherwise, that would hurt her.

1) Still **damaged**. I can only accept it, try to be understanding, and attempt to help with her repairs.
2) She's all better, and back to her chipper, energetic, non-coughing and queasy self. I'm glad it worked out all right on the SW and administration side as well.
3) I'm sorry, I don't have it on me, as it's my mom's recipe and she hasn't taught it to me yet (just my sisters). I'll try and get ahold of it, though.
Still ongoing, no change from my last thread-time. We went on a picnic on wednesday, and I'm considering something for either tomorrow or monday, depending on scheduling, weather, difficulties with my dad, etc. Nothing about my place in particular, other than telling me I should dust more.

No wifi with the mario kart as of yet...or as of since the accident, anyway. It's hard to play well with the one fully functional hand; we just play single player cooperatively together, as it is. I think she'd just played face to face with her friends previously.

>  _<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_codesDO> NOT DOUBT THE WORDS OF WIKI._
Hmm...that's very interesting. So, what I've come to thus far as far as conclusions go: Anyone having her friend code is useless unless she has theirs and adds it to her list or something. I assume one can remove friend codes, and thus access, as well?
