Hey, /v/. I have a question, if it isn't too much trouble for you. With pokemon pearl (or diamond, I guess), when one exchanges friend codes, does one give up personal or IP information of some sort? And, more importantly, what are the capacities for communication over wireless and such? Can one send text messages, or things like that, or is it limited to non-personalized battling and trading and such?

See, I'm considering whether it's wise to solicit said codes for wireless play for a certain someone, or...not so much.

Picture not entirely related, but /v/ish.

I don't see how. unless there's some way to use the Friend code as a dowsing rod for IP addresses. They don't really have anything to do with one another. If you take a DS or Wii to a different IP, it still uses the same friendcode. 

tl;dr: what >>3752743 said

Yes, but what about the communication issue? Just what can one do to communicate with someone you have a friend code with? I can't check the manual and such, because it's still in the box, which is still in the store, on hold for me.

I've seen people on 4chan who have it disabled. I'm not really sure how, but they might just have their volume turned off. In which case... Nintendo Wifi can sense that it's off 'cause it shows a "no megaphone" icon by their name.

yes.. but if you try to connect to someone with it on, you must turn your VOIP on

if you invite with VOIP off, they must deactivate VOIP to do stuff with you

I imagine covering the mic with a piece of thick tape might be a low-tech solution as well.

Too bad my wifi's shot to hell and back, or I'd gladly try it out for you.

That's a good idea, actually. I wouldn't have thought of that. Hmm. At this rate, it looks like I may need to do some test driving before I make a decision and hand it, and potentially friend codes people may offer, over to her one way or another...

Thanks.

Okay, another question...if you had the opportunity, would you play some pokeymans with her? I can't really say how she'd 'behave' on it, but she's certainly a lot more tolerable to me than any other kid her age I've spent time with...but I suppose I'm a bit biased.

Are you sure 4chan is the best crowd to introduce a young girl to? We may be awesome at pokemon, but we are really lousy babysitters.

Yes, she has one arm, one eye, and she's missing her legs above the knee; a result of which, along with the orphaning due to her parents dying in the crash that inflicted said injuries, she's living in a nursing home, surrounded by old people and professional caregivers, as a ward of the state. 

As such, she doesn't really get out much, or get to play or interact with people her own age, which is why I'm considering any of this at all.

Well...she was quite handy with the internets, apparently, before the accident, and losing her home/room/own PC/internet access/etc. And with young and intelligent parents, I'm fairly sure, as she's told me herself, that they taught her how to be careful on it. So she isn't an entirely wideeyed Amish kid exposed to the online abyss for the first time.

Still, if it's limited to seeing Seakings named 'Fuck Yeah', that'd be acceptable. It isn't as if she hasn't heard such words before, after all.

find a forum with younger people that perhaps they could actually talk to over VOIP as well as battle.

I don't know of any forums with such people, though I'm trying to think of some. I don't really browse nintendo or pokeymans forums, y'know? Not that there's anything wrong with that...

...even so, I'm not sure how much good it would do, as she has yet to initiate contact with anyone her own age when we've been out and about thus far...not peaceful contact, anyway. She has some issues with 'normal' kids...

Doesn't she have REAL friends to play Pokemans with? That would solve most of the problems right there.

What age is the loli in question, anyway?

Nurse-kun, I still think it's a bad idea. You just know someone's going to point her to wikichan. And I gather that may not be something you want, what with the 'should i stick it in her pooper /b/?' and stuff...

That sort of thing would be what I'm worried about...well, not wikichan, really, since her only form of internet access is her DS, and she doesn't have the web browser thing I think I saw somewhere once, but problematic mails through trades and such in general, ranging a gamut of various subjects. My best idea is to ask her to let me read them first when she gets one, since she knows how people can behave online, though I'm not sure the game supports that, or such. Been a while since I played one, and not the new version yet.

the forums at Serebii.net might be a good choice. If you don't mind her learning the ways of the tourneytard. She can trade, battle, and all that to her heart's content.

REMEMBERING YOU EXIST AND THEREFORE READING UP ON WIKICHAN

I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE VIA POKEMONS SINCE I DON'T OWN THE GAME, BUT I HERD THAT CHATOT HAS AN ATTACK THAT LETS YOU RECORD YOUR VOICE. THEN AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WORKS ON WI-FI. JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE.

ALROUND, GIVING OUT HER FRIEND CODE TO /b/ IS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA, IF YOU WERE CONSIDERING IT. MY 2 CENTS.

Sup Nurse-kun, anyway, only VOIP is possible, but how would she get someone's friend code, or give out hers in the first place if all she has is a DS?

Anonymous 05/31/07(Thu)08:30 No.3753198 
Also, not only does she need to give out her friend code, they need to give you their friend code before any form of battling or trading can be done over wi-fi

Good luck then, it's safe. Unless a /b/tard manages to trade friend codes, and decides to spell out a message to ask her to check wikichan via Pokeman names.

So long as it doesn't have the capability to spell out complex original messages, it's fine. It uses pre-set phrases and buzzwords?

Hi. Cheer up, you guys, it's a beautiful day where I am...and dwelling on the dark won't accomplish anything. I know that, despite my frequent jokes (well, partial jokes) about the toxicity of 4chan, there are probably at least a few people on here that actually care about her. Which is why I'm asking this here, and considering the possibility of trying to find some of those people for friend codes, at all.

People are always saying that I 'restore their faith in humanity' or 'inspire them to do more with their lives' or such, which is hard for me to believe, because I'm just, you know, a guy. But the truth is, a lot of you have given me a new way of looking at Anonymous, as well. Hm, tired, sentimental.
