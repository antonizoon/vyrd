<p>Hey, /b/. I just realized, yesterday, that it's been almost a month
since I last posted here; mostly due to my busy schedule this time of
year, partly due to what seemed like a lack of interest. I've barely
had time to even browse /b/, as it is, being occupied with errands to
run and double shifts to work.
</p><p>She, and by 'she' I refer to 'Amputee-tan' or 'Maimed-tan' or
'Damaged-Goods-Tan' or whatever else you may call her, has been doing
relatively well for the last few weeks, at least, since the primary
holiday season ended. She enjoyed the gifts I rustled up for her (with
the assistance of some smaller contributions from the rest of the
staff), said gifts including her own copy of EBA, several books, and an
ipod; the stuff my own family came up with later on christmas day went
over pretty well too, mostly consisting of clothes and books...she's
still wearing the sweater my mom got her quite a bit.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: 19404818">edit</a>]</div><a name="19404818"></a><h3>19404818</h3>
<p>Like I was saying before, it's been pretty hectic. I've approached
her social worker to make some inquiries about the possibilities of
guardianship, and how one would go about applying for such things, and
she was somewhat helpful, thankfully, though she has warned me that it
wouldn't be easy, for reasons I've listed before. Still, I'm working at
it, and my cousin the lawyer, who I'd also mentioned and who was there
at christmas, has been lending a hand as well, pro-bono, looking into
and inquiring about, family law with a friend and colleague that
specializes in the field. All in all, that aspect is looking pretty
good, particularly since I have my family's support in this...they all
thought she was pretty darn awesome when they showed up at the home
christmas night, and met her for themselves...which felt really good to
see, since she took it so well.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: 19404942">edit</a>]</div><a name="19404942"></a><h3>19404942</h3>
<p>There's really just too much to talk about, if I were to mention
everything...I could write a small book, really, and since I'm not a
writer, and it's my day off, that isn't terribly appealing to me. So I
guess I'll open the floor to questions, and try to answer them as best
I can, at this point. You know, if anyone cares enough to have any,
that is.
</p><p>Oh, one note before I do so: I did wind up sticking it in her pooper. It was messy.
</p><p>(ok, joke made out of her problem with constipation and the application of suppositories out of the way now)
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: 19405100">edit</a>]</div><a name="19405100"></a><h3>19405100</h3>
<p>Since most of the residents don't know what the hell an iPod is, let
alone what to do with it, and the staff helped get it for her and all
know who's it is (the 'Property of 'Her Name'' engraved on the back
helps there), it shouldn't be much of a problem. If a visitor or
someone at the rehab facility were to do so, I'm fairly sure that our
friendly neighbourhood Swarthy Security Specialist would track up the
culprit and break his/her kneecaps before retrieving it.
</p><p>She and he have struck up a bit of a rapport in the last few
weeks, as it turns out that she'd had a friend in her class
pre-accident that belonged to his particular class/sect combination, so
she 'gets him' in those ways more than pretty much any of us adults.
</p>

<p>Bel-Air? Taken away? What? Shit, someone actually tried to copypasta
as me? I don't know if I should feel honored or offended. Was this
stuff in the wiki?
</p><p>Anyway, no, it isn't a Bel-Air (as if people that believe that
will believe me saying so), and she wasn't taken away...I haven't
posted since christmas morning, so if I've been 'seen' since then, it
wasn't me.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: 19405437">edit</a>]</div><a name="19405437"></a><h3>19405437</h3>
<p>I have the headstart on her, but she's got the skills with her 'off'
hand on me. And she's been playing it for over a month now, and is
doing pretty fucking awesome at it in doing so...she's most of the way
through Hard ROCK mode (god, she did not handle the christmas stage
well, as I predicted, but she's more or less gotten used to it by now),
and generally whoops my non-crippled ass on that difficulty when we
play head to head. I can barely make it up to Let's
Dance/Anthem/Survivor's 'level' on that difficulty, as is...she's just
stuck on JJF, but she's getting closer to beating it all the time.
</p><p>Her 'hands' rehab nurse has mentioned that it's been really
helpful to her skill with her left hand, and she's doing better with
her new right myoelectric all the time. I'm just glad she's having fun.
</p>

<p>Sadly, my skills at visual art are more or less nonexistent. I couldn't even manage a decent stick figure of her if I tried.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: 19405733">edit</a>]</div><a name="19405733"></a><h3>19405733</h3>
<p>Well, my last two posts disappeared within ten minutes or so, with
about 20 posts to each apiece, a quarter of which were me, and half of
which were 'gtfo fag'...a guy can get the message after awhile.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: 19406143">edit</a>]</div><a name="19406143"></a><h3>19406143</h3>
<p>Well...she hasn't exactly started arm-thrusting herself out of her
bed to flying-hug me when I walk into her room or anything, but I like
to think she's continuing to open up to me, slowly but surely...
</p><p>We talk more, now, when she can't sleep, or after she has
another nightmare (which are still very commonplace). About anything
she'd like, which usually includes what happened during the day, while
I was away. She's telling me about things that frustrate or annoy her,
rather than keeping it all to herself, and at the same time, she's also
admitting it when she likes or enjoys something, too, which is even
newer. I've managed to fill her iPod with most of the songs she's asked
for (has an amazing memory, can list exact track and artist names and
sources for most of them, which I, well, can't), which has helped too,
particularly on the bussing to and from the rehab facility, I've been
told.
</p><p>Our resident headshrinker says that she mentions me fairly
often in sessions, almost always in a positive way, which is good...and
when it hasn't been overly positive, I've tried to correct my behaviour
when I can, but a lot of those 'problems' seem to stem from being
reminded of her father, thus making her feel bad...
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: 19406604">edit</a>]</div><a name="19406604"></a><h3>19406604</h3>
<p>For the record, though I mentioned this initially, it wasn't
technically BUTTSEX. It was a professional doing a professional's job
for a suffering patient, that's all. No more, no less.
</p><p>I even wore a latex glove while doing so, which is not standard
BUTTSEX protocal, as far as I am aware (my BUTTSEX familiarity is
somewhat lacking, I will admit)
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: 19407451">edit</a>]</div><a name="19407451"></a><h3>19407451</h3>
<p>She's beautiful. Beautiful for a child, that is, of course, rather
than an adult's beautiful. Even as broken as she still is inside, and
with the scarring over her eye, I'd say she's the most beautiful little
girl I've ever seen.
</p><p>Well, she is. You'd agree with me if you saw her.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: 19407601">edit</a>]</div><a name="19407601"></a><h3>19407601</h3>
<p>At this point, some sort of 'arrangement' (which is pretty messed up
even outside of official scrutiny, I mean, really) would probably just
do more harm than good for my petition. As for girlfriends, I don't
have any issues with seeking them out, and I've actually been getting
to know the new girl at the local coffeeshop, considering asking her
out the next time I'm in there (which will probably be tomorrow).
</p><p>Still, if it does happen, it's the sort of commitment that
would need to be made by everyone involved in the household, including
any girlfriends...and it's also the sort that tends to drive casual
people away and split previously strong marriages apart. I can always
hope, but it's a big thing to face.
</p>

<p>I'm not sure, but from what the social worker and my cousin have
indicated, it'd be at least a month or so in red tape before any
progress was made from the time a formal application for consideration
is made and the time it gets looked at by someone in authority, even.
Actual vettings and such would be longer, of course.

<p>Well...she's talked about how when I've been nice to her,
particularly when comforting her after nightmares, that I make her
think about her father. Which, considering her circumstances, is a
painful thing to do, even if all her memories of him are good
ones...maybe especially because they're good ones. I mean, it isn't
healthy for her to have withdrawn as much as she has, a common symptom
in PTSD, and she needs to learn to 'feel' again without 'flinching',
but...it still hurts, she's said, and I'd have to imagine.
</p><p>It makes me feel bad for her, and good inside for her comparing
me to him, having clearly loved him tremendously as she did...very

<p>Well, I may try to be a bit more frequent in my updates, since at least a few people still seem to care, faggort-flooders aside.
</p><p>As a side note, I finally read through Nana's Everyday Life on Dan Kim's website a few weeks back, for the first time...
</p><p>...it just hardened my resolve to do the right thing for this
real girl. Fiction will remain that way, if I have anything to say
about it.

<p>I haven't given them any reason to suspect me of anything, mostly
because I really haven't done anything wrong, as of yet. I mean, the
suppository incident was the deepest I've waded into shit creek thus
far (ho ho, i am so witty), and even that was just me doing my
job...the fact that I've talked about her with most of them, and made
the fact that her situation makes me feel for her clear, probably helps
with my general transparency level, too, of course.
</p>

<p>It was december 28th, and all was calm as I came into work for the
first of two shifts I'd be working that day...3 pm, the late-afternoon
to evening shift, and then my usual 11 to 7 night shift. I'd been
working double-shifts for more than a week now, and I was beginning to
approach the fine edge of raggedness, but I was soldiering on like a
good little trooper as is the role of the nurse, after all.
</p><p>She'd been pretty calm for the past few days, the unexpected
buoying of christmas spirit outpouring overcoming the sting of loss
she'd felt at facing her first yuletide alone. The only notable
incident had been two days previous, when she'd been trying to stand on
her own, beside her bed, on her still-new legs, and taken a fall...when
I found her, hearing the crash of plastic and metal prosthetics against
furniture in her downward arc from the hallway, she was already in
angry tears, biting her lip and practically tearing her legs off
herself in frustration, a state which I had to work hard to calm her up
from, indeed.
</p>

<p>I was giving the log of the morning's activities a quick
read-through before getting to the real business at hand when I noted a
note in the notices section of her file: 'patient appears to be
suffering from abdominal discomfort, refused breakfast'. A frown of
worry crossing my face, and making sure there weren't any outstanding
calls for assistance (there weren't), I headed for her room, knocking
lightly with the back of my hand before opening the door and peeking
inside.
</p><p>She was curled up on her right side, facing the wall, and
appeared to have her earbuds in, listening to her iPod. Figuring that
she wouldn't notice me from where I was, particularly as she hadn't
made any sign that she had as of yet, I stepped into her room, closing
the door behind myself and approaching her bed.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: 19410576">edit</a>]</div><a name="19410576"></a><h3>19410576</h3>
<p>Once I got close, I spoke her name loudly enough for her to hear,
with her starting slightly from where she'd been reading one of her new
books. After she'd sat up somewhat and removed her earphones, and I'd
apologized for startling her, I asked her how she was feeling. She told
me that she was fine...a bit evasively, but I'd grown accustomed to her
tendency to hide her true state of affairs for one reason or another,
so a clear conclusion of how she really felt was hard to arrive at.
Still, there was little point in badgering her, so I changed the
subject, making light conversation about how her morning had been, how
her rehab had gone (she'd just returned a few minutes before I arrived
at work), and so on, and so forth. I was called away before too long
and had to attend to my other patients, leaving her alone again, as
always.
</p>

<p>The Greatest Generation kept me busy until around seven that
evening; she generally had her meals brought to her in her room, very
rarely feeling sociable enough to brave the horrors of the senile
geriatric dining experience. When I finally had a short break in the
neverending stream of depends and ben gay, I checked in on her again,
just to be sure...and, sure enough, she'd barely touched her dinner
tray, just having sipped some juice, already reading another book
(fortunately, the family practically bought a crate of them for her,
considering the rate at which she went through them).
</p><p>I pulled up her chair to her bedside and took a seat, probably
looking worried, as it was how I felt. I asked how she was feeling,
again, and she looked up, again, and said she was fine...just not
feeling very hungry, that's all. Then she told me that she needed to
use the washroom, in what I later realized was an attempt to change the
subject of her own; still, I carried her over, and she did urinate, at
least a bit, so my concerns were assuaged somewhat. I helped her get
cleaned up, then took her back to her bed, telling her I'd be back in a
bit longer, that we could play some mario kart, as I was being called
away by more calls from the damned old.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22" title="Edit section: 19411831">edit</a>]</div><a name="19411831"></a><h3>19411831</h3>
<p>Another three hours passed by before I was even able to check my
watch again, and as the ice-floe candidates began to pack it in for the
night, to dream of jalopies and punching nazis and segregated drinking
fountains, I finally made my way back to her room.
</p><p>I opened her door to find her laying on her side again, curled
up (as much as she can, anyway, what remains of her thighs drawn up
toward her stomach) and making small whimpering sounds. Needless to
say, I found this very worrisome, and rushed right over to her bedside,
asking her what was wrong. After a moment's hesitation, she finally
admitted that her stomach had hurt since last night...and, after a few
more moments of consideration, the conclusion was reached that she
hadn't had a proper bowel movement in at least five days. It seems that
she'd been somewhat embarassed to ask me to he;lp her with that
particular bodily function in the washroom, and that 'holding in' while
I'd started working double shifts, combined with another new nurse on
the third shift of the day, with her usual two on vacation, combined
with the painkillers she was still on due to lingering pain at her
amputation sites...well, it all combined to make for a painful package,
pardon the pun.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: 19412408">edit</a>]</div><a name="19412408"></a><h3>19412408</h3>
<p>I was somewhat dumbstruck my this situation, to say the least. I
mean, I'd already been assisting her with washroom trips for number 1,
and while it had been decided that policy in her case would be that the
female nurses would bathe her (understandable, really), it wasn't as
though I hadn't seen anything, thus far. Still, turning it over in my
mind, I had to admit that I'd never helped her with this before...maybe
she had a reason for shyness in this area, I really didn't know, one
way or another...but I did know that it was my duty to help her,
somehow.
</p><p>She was still trying to suppress little whimpers of pain as all
of the above ran through my little mind, and I pulled myself back to
the present, taking her small hand into my own and giving it a gentle
squeeze, giving my best reassuring smile at the same time. I told her
it was all right, that she didn't do anything wrong...and that I could
help her. I began to explain how an enema works...and she cut me off,
an upset expression on her face as she told me that she'd already had
that done once, while she was in the hospital, and she never wanted it
to happen again, that she hated how it made her feel in her 'tummy'. I
was a little surprised, but recovered admirably, I think...and after a
mere second's thought, I propose...the route of the suppository.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: 19412760">edit</a>]</div><a name="19412760"></a><h3>19412760</h3>
<p>She was rather hesitant and nervous once I explained said
alternative to her, but I assured her that it was quick, firstly, and
that it was one of the two recommended treatments for someone her age
with her problem, the other being the fleet enema. She finally accepted
it, but clearly wasn't too thrilled...I couldn't really blame her, and
patted her shoulder gently, extricating my own hand and heading for the
supply room for the necessary materials.
</p><p>Doublechecking the instructions on the package, I split one of
the suppositories in half, and, with an extra pair of latex gloves and
lubricant in hand, headed back to her room, doublechecking my pager on
the way, to make sure there weren't any other emergencies to distract
me.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: 19414015">edit</a>]</div><a name="19414015"></a><h3>19414015</h3>
<p>Anyway, I got back to the room, and further explained the procedure
to her. She didn't look too thrilled, but really, who could blame her?
I could only promise her that I'd be as gentle as possible, and that
I'd bring her some ice cream from the kitchen after it was
over...somewhat transparent bribery, true, but I had to try something a
bit softer than 'suck it up (your pooper)'.
</p><p>I helped her remove her underwear, setting it aside, and
tugging her gown up slightly, to leave her rear exposed, then, after a
quick hand sanitizer application, I donned the latex gloves, and
squeezed a dab of lubricant onto the tip of my right middle finger,
since I'd be using my index finger to peel the suppository in a moment.
With a calming word of warning ahead of time, I spread her cheeks
gently, just enough to expose her anus, with my left hand, and shifted
my right in to carefully rub the bead of lube over and into it, just a
bit...she tensed up at first, gasping softly, and I paused, letting her
adjust...
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" title="Edit section: 19414601">edit</a>]</div><a name="19414601"></a><h3>19414601 </h3>
<p>After about five seconds of her trying to instinctively 'squeeze me
out', she finally started to relax, my murmered encouragement and
praise for her courage perhaps helping, perhaps not, and I withdrew,
reasoning from experience that it was better to get it out of the way
now than while trying to actually insert the tablet. Patting her
shoulder and telling her how well she was doing, I moved on to unwrap
the foil from the tablet, and scrape away the bit of an edge the
machine left on one side, while applying a light coating of the
remaining lube from my middle finger to the 'top' of the tablet,
pointed for easier insertion. Then I squeezed a more generous quantity
onto my index finger's length, gripped the suppository between said
index finger and thumb, and spread her cheeks again, letting her know
to relax, as I placed the tip against her anus.
</p><p>I shifted my left hand, now that my finger was ready and
waiting, up to tug the glove off, and offer said hand to her...after a
moment, she reached out to squeeze it with her own, and I told her that
it'd be over in a few seconds. I began counting up from three, and as I
finished, I pressed in, gently but firmly, and after a momentary
resistance, slipped the tablet, and my finger, inside her.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27" title="Edit section: 19415115">edit</a>]</div><a name="19415115"></a><h3>19415115</h3>
<p>She cried out as I entered her, mostly out of surprise, as it was a
new experience for her, despite having had other entries in the past.
Her hand squeezed mine almost painfully, as tightly as she could, her
eyes squeezed shut when I looked up to her face to make sure she was
all right...it wasn't an expression of serious pain, just of
discomfort, so I continued, to try and get it over with as quickly as I
could.
</p><p>Sliding my finger in further, squeezed on all sides by
impressive pressure and heat, I soon met some resistance as it reached
her hardened stool. Sliding my finger around just a bit, to see if it
could go any further, she groaned, trying to stifle herself without
much success, her hips shifting uneasily, hand squeezing mine again.
Realizing that attempting a deeper penetration wouldn't do much good, I
relented, nudging the suppository away from my fingertip as I started
to withdraw it, not lingering unduly, but not moving too fast, to avoid
exacerbating the situation. Finally, as my finger slid out of her anus
completely, a small wet sound accompanying it as she squeezed shut
behind it, she moaned one last time, her hips shifting again on the
bed, as I peeled the glove off as best I could, using my teeth on the
wristline, and tossed it, with the other one, into her wastebasket.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28" title="Edit section: 19415515">edit</a>]</div><a name="19415515"></a><h3> 19415515 </h3>
<p>I tugged her gown back up to he;lp her cover herself up, and pulled
the sheets up a bit as well, to cover her stumps, giving her hand a
squeeze as it continued to hold onto my own, and telling her how brave
she was, and how well she handled that, helping her turn onto her back
back, and reaching up to brush her hair out of her eyes with my free
hand as she opened them again. I told her how it'd be a while before it
finished working, and she asked me to stay with her while it did,
looking a bit scared; I promised that I would, and moved to sit on the
edge of the bed beside her, continuing to hold her hand within my own.
</p><p>After about five minutes, she started to shift about beneath
the bedsheets, and complained that she felt uncomfortable 'in there',
that it burned a little...I reassured her that it was normal to feel
that way, and that it wouldn't be too much longer...as time went on, it
just got worse, but she just bit her lip and made a visible effort to
ignore it after ten minutes, though her hand started squeezing mine
more tightly.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;">[<a href="http://wikichan.org/wiki/index.php?title=Story:DamagedGoods:Chapter_8&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29" title="Edit section: 19416030">edit</a>]</div><a name="19416030"></a><h3> 19416030 </h3>
<p>I did my best to be a soothing presence, stroking her hair with my
free hand, while murmering words of encouragement, praising her on how
well she was handling it...and, eventually, as we approached the
half-hour mark, she began to shift more and more urgently under the
bedsheets, her thighs rubbing together, until finally, she groaned
again, deeply, and told me, a bit panickedly, that it was time. I
scooped her up as quickly as I could, having shifted to a more ready
position as I anticipated things coming to a head, and hurried into the
washroom, helping her to take her seat on the toilet, and holding her
steady with my free hand on her hip, my left still tightly held in her
own, as she began moaning again, her eyes squeezed tightly shut,
hunching forward slightly...
</p><p>And, well, she relieved herself. I'll spare you the details. I
helped her clean up after she was finished, which took a while, and
left her drenched in sweat, giving her a quick abbreviated spongebath
in her bathing area, then carried her back to her bed and laid her up
again. I told her that she didn't need to be shy about asking me, or
the other nurses, for he;lp when she needed it...not even for this;
that hopefully, one experience like this would be enough, to which she
agreed. Then she leaned toward me, and gave me her best attempt at a
hug...which, once I got past surprise, I returned.

<dl><dd><i>re: "nurse-kun is awesum! it's not a very interesting question but what's in that iPod? What does she listen to?"</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>To answer this question rather late, she listens to a lot of
different things; some japanese pop stuff, which I have no ideas the
subtleties of, but I'm sure she does; classical music, mozart and
beethoven in particular; a few videogame tracks; and some assorted
miscellaneous stuff, including copies of the original songs from EBA,
which she asked me for but hadn't had before, and I tracked up,
eventually. She's a pretty eclectic little kid.

know you mentioned she was doing well with her DS, but how well can she
use her legs, etc?"</i>
</dd></dl>
<p>Her rehab is progressing well, all in all. She's getting better with
her legs all the time, and tried the standing-by-her-bed trick I
mentioned her failing at nearly a month ago again while I was watching,
just recently, and succeeded, shaky though she was...she was in a
pretty good mood for the rest of the night after that.
